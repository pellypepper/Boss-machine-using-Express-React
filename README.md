Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)
npm (Node Package Manager)
Step-by-Step Setup
Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

First, navigate to the directory and install the frontend dependencies:




bash
Copy code
cd client
npm install
Then, navigate to the backend folder (server) and install the backend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd ../server
npm install
Start the backend server:

In the server folder, run:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the backend server on port 4001. Ensure that the server is running correctly by checking the logs in the terminal.

Start the frontend development server:

In the client folder, run:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the frontend development server on port 3000 (or whatever port is configured in your package.json).

Access the application:

Once both servers are running, open your browser and visit:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:4001
This will load the frontend of the application.
